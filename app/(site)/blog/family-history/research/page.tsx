                <p>
                  Family health is crucial for individual well-being because
                  families often share genes, lifestyles, and environments that
                  can increase the risk of certain health conditions.
                  Documenting and sharing health records within families and
                  with healthcare providers is more important than ever for
                  several reasons, including improved care coordination, faster
                  diagnoses, reduced medical errors, and enhanced preventative
                  health measures.
