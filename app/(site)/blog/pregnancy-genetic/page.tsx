                    Pregnancy is a transformative journey that often comes with
                    many questions about the baby’s health and development. One
                    of the most common concerns for expectant parents is the
                    risk of passing along genetic conditions. According to the
                    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), genetic
                    disorders are caused by changes or mutations in the DNA{" "}

                    </span>
                    . Understanding what these conditions are and how they might
                    be inherited can help you make informed decisions and
                    prepare for a healthier pregnancy.

                    While there are numerous genetic conditions, some are more
                    commonly discussed during pregnancy due to their prevalence
                    or impact on fetal development:

                    Modern healthcare is increasingly leveraging Artificial
                    Intelligence (AI) to detect genetic markers and predict
                    potential complications early in pregnancy:

                    <li>
                      <strong>Risk Analysis Models:</strong> AI algorithms can
                      sift through massive amounts of genetic data to pinpoint
                      risk factors more accurately than traditional methods.

                    At-Home Genetic Tests Prior to Pregnancy

                    Genetic testing isn’t limited to when you’re already
                    pregnant. Prospective parents who want to screen for known
                    hereditary issues can opt for at-home test kits, often
                    referred to as “carrier tests.” These usually involve
                    providing a saliva or cheek swab sample and sending it to a
                    lab for analysis. Some popular tests on the market screen
                    for conditions like cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular
                    atrophy, and Fragile X syndrome{" "}

                    <strong>Important Note:</strong> While at-home tests offer
                    convenience, they should not replace professional medical
                    advice. Always consult with a genetic counselor or OB/GYN
                    for confirmation and additional guidance.
