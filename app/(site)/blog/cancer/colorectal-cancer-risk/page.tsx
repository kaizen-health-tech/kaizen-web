                  Could Your Yogurt Habit Be Shielding You From Colon Cancer?
                  New Study Says Yes!
                </h1>

                <p>
                  Emerging research suggests yogurt might play a surprising role
                  in protecting against **colon cancer**. A groundbreaking study
                  published in <em>Gut Microbes</em> reveals that eating just
                  **two servings of yogurt per week** could lower the risk of
                  certain aggressive colon cancers by **20%**.

                  The Spoonful That Packs a Punch: Study Highlights
                </h2>

                <h3 className="pt-4">What Did Researchers Find?</h3>
                <p>
                  Scientists tracked over 130,000 people for 30+ years and
                  discovered that yogurt lovers (≥2 servings weekly) had a **20%
                  lower risk** of developing *Bifidobacterium*-positive proximal
                  colon cancer.
                </p>

                <h3 className="pt-4">Why Focus on *Bifidobacterium*?</h3>
                <p>
                  *Bifidobacterium* is a beneficial probiotic strain found in
                  yogurt. Tumors harboring this bacteria made up **31% of cases
                  studied**, and yogurt’s benefits were strongest against these
                  specific tumors.

                <h3 className="pt-4">Why Right-Sided Colon Cancer?</h3>
                <p>
                  The study found yogurt’s benefits were strongest for
                  right-sided (proximal) colon cancers, which are harder to
                  detect early and more lethal.

                  How Much Yogurt Should You Eat?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  **At least two 6-ounce servings per week** is recommended.
                  Avoid sugar-loaded varieties and opt for **plain Greek
                  yogurt**.

                <h3 className="pt-4">Lactose Intolerant?</h3>
                <p>
                  Fermented yogurts like Greek or skyr are lower in lactose, and
                  plant-based yogurts with live cultures can be a good
                  alternative.

                <p>
                  Yogurt isn’t a cure, but this study highlights its potential
